 1.  Java is an object-oriented programming language. This means that everything in Java is an object, which has properties and methods that define its behavior.
    
2.  Java is a compiled language, which means that you need to compile your Java code into bytecode before you can run it. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) then executes the bytecode on your computer.
    
3.  Java has a strong type system. This means that every variable in Java has a specific data type, and you need to declare the type of each variable before you can use it.
    
4.  Java has a number of built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values.
    
5.  Java has a number of control structures that you can use to control the flow of your program. These include if/else statements, loops, and switch statements.
    
6.  Java has a number of built-in classes and libraries that you can use to perform common programming tasks, such as reading and writing files, working with dates and times, and connecting to databases.
    
7.  Java has a main() method that serves as the entry point for your program. This is the method that gets executed when you run your Java program.

### Data structures
1.  Arrays: An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. Arrays are indexed using integers, and elements can be accessed by their index.
    
2.  ArrayList: An ArrayList is a resizable array, meaning its size can be changed dynamically. ArrayLists are implemented using an array, but they provide additional functionality, such as adding and removing elements, searching for elements, and more.
    
3.  LinkedList: A LinkedList is a collection of nodes, where each node contains an element and a reference to the next node in the list. LinkedLists provide fast insertion and deletion of elements, but they are slower for accessing elements at a specific index.
    
4.  HashSet: A HashSet is an unordered collection of unique elements. HashSet uses hashing to store elements, which provides fast access and retrieval times.
    
5.  TreeSet: A TreeSet is a sorted set, meaning its elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or a custom comparator. TreeSet is implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree, which provides fast search, insertion, and deletion times.
    
6.  HashMap: A HashMap is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. HashMap uses hashing to store keys, which provides fast access and retrieval times.
    
7.  TreeMap: A TreeMap is a sorted map, meaning its entries are ordered according to their natural ordering or a custom comparator. TreeMap is implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree, which provides fast search, insertion, and deletion times.
