## DTO example 

```csharp
public class ProductDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```
In the above example, `ProductDto` is a DTO class representing a product. It includes properties such as `Id`, `Name`, `Price`, and `Description`, which are relevant for transferring product data between different layers or components of the application. This DTO focuses on the specific data needed for communication or presentation purposes and does not include any persistence-related attributes or methods.

## Database model

```csharp
[Table("Products")]
public class Product
{
    [Key]
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [StringLength(100)]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Column(TypeName = "decimal(18, 2)")]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    [StringLength(500)]
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```
In this example, `Product` is a database model class that represents a product entity to be stored in a database. It includes annotations (`[Table]`, `[Key]`, `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`) to define the table name, primary key, data validation rules, and column mappings. These attributes provide metadata to the underlying database framework (e.g., Entity Framework Core) for mapping the class properties to database columns and enforcing data constraints.

*The database model includes properties such as `Id`, `Name`, `Price`, and `Description`, which align with the DTO structure. However, the database model class contains additional annotations and persistence-related attributes specific to the database operations, such as defining primary keys, specifying column types, and enforcing data validation constraints
It's important to note that DTOs and database models serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. DTOs focus on data transfer and communication, while database models focus on data persistence and database interactions.*


**Dtos and database models are something like models and serializers in python**
