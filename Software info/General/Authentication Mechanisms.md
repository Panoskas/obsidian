## 1. Password-based Authentication  
The most common method where users prove their identity using a secret password.  
  
### Pros:  
- Simple to implement  
- Familiar to users  
- No additional hardware required  
  
### Cons:  
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks  
- Users often choose weak passwords  
- Can be forgotten or stolen  
  
### Best Practices:  
- Enforce strong password policies  
- Implement rate limiting  
- Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)  
- Store hashed passwords, never plaintext  
  
## 2. Token-based Authentication  
Uses tokens (like JWT) to manage user sessions.  
  
### How it works:  
1. User logs in with credentials  
2. Server validates and returns a signed token  
3. Client stores token and sends it with subsequent requests  
4. Server verifies token signature for each request  
  
### Types of Tokens:  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Self-contained tokens with encoded user data  
- **Opaque Tokens**: Random strings mapped to user data on the server  
  
### Advantages:  
- Stateless authentication  
- Good for microservices architecture  
- Can include user roles/permissions in token  
  
## 3. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)  
Requires two or more verification factors:  
- Something you know (password)  
- Something you have (phone)  
- Something you are (fingerprint)  
  
### Common MFA Methods:  
- SMS codes  
- Authenticator apps (TOTP)  
- Hardware security keys  
- Biometric verification  
  
## 4. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect  
Industry-standard protocols for authorization and authentication.  
  
### Use Cases:  
- Single Sign-On (SSO)  
- Third-party application access  
- API authorization  
  
### Common Flows:  
- Authorization Code Flow  
- Implicit Flow  
- Client Credentials Flow  
  
## 5. Certificate-based Authentication  
Uses digital certificates to identify users or devices.  
  
### Common Uses:  
- SSL/TLS client authentication  
- IoT device authentication  
- VPN access  
  
## Security Considerations  
- Always use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks  
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attempts  
- Use secure session management  
- Keep authentication libraries up-to-date  
- Regularly audit authentication logs  
  
# Password vs Token Authentication: Key Differences  
  
## 1. Session Management  
  
### Password-based Authentication  
- Server maintains session state  
- Typically uses server-side sessions stored in memory or a database  
- Client stores a session ID (usually in a cookie)  
```  
User → Login with password → Server creates session → Session ID sent to client  
```  
  
### Token-based Authentication  
- Stateless - server doesn't need to store session data  
- Client stores the token (typically in local storage or cookies)  
- All necessary data is contained within the token  
```  
User → Login with password → Server generates token → Token sent to client  
```  
  
## 2. How They Work  
  
### Password-based Flow:  
1. User enters username/password  
2. Server verifies credentials  
3. Server creates a session and stores it  
4. Server sends session ID to client  
5. Client sends session ID with each request  
6. Server looks up session data for each request  
  
### Token-based Flow:  
1. User enters username/password  
2. Server verifies credentials  
3. Server generates a signed token containing user data  
4. Client stores token  
5. Client sends token with each request  
6. Server verifies token signature (no database lookup needed)  
  
## 3. Scalability  
  
### Password-based Authentication  
- Less scalable due to server-side session storage  
- Requires sticky sessions in load-balanced environments  
- Additional database load for session lookups  
  
### Token-based Authentication  
- Highly scalable - no server-side storage needed  
- Works well in distributed systems and microservices  
- Any server can verify the token  
  
## 4. Security Considerations  
  
### Password-based Authentication  
- Vulnerable to CSRF attacks unless properly mitigated  
- Sessions can be hijacked if session ID is stolen  
- Server can invalidate sessions immediately  
  
### Token-based Authentication  
- Tokens can't be revoked before expiration (mitigation: short expiry + refresh tokens)  
- Must be carefully configured to prevent XSS attacks  
- Larger attack surface if tokens contain sensitive data  
  
  
## 6. Use Case Recommendations  
  
### Choose Password-based (with sessions) when:  
- Building a simple, monolithic application  
- Need immediate session invalidation  
- Working in environments where client-side storage is limited  
  
### Choose Token-based when:  
- Building distributed systems or microservices  
- Need to support multiple client applications (mobile, web, etc.)  
- Want to reduce database lookups  
- Implementing cross-domain authentication
