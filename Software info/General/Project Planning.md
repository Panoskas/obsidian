Project planning is important at every phase of a project. It lays out the basics of a project, including the following:

-   scope
-   objectives
-   goals
-   schedule

Planning enables project managers to turn an intangible idea into reality. Key purposes of planning include the following:

-   facilitate communication and provide a central source of information for project personnel;
-   help the project sponsor and other key [stakeholders](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/stakeholder) know what is required;
-   identify who will perform certain tasks, and when and how those tasks will happen;
-   facilitate [project management](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/project-management) and control as the project progresses;
-   enable effective monitoring and control of a project;
-   manage project risk; and
-   generate feedback useful for the next project planning phase.

### How do you create a project plan?

Project planning includes the following 10 steps:

1.  **Define stakeholders.** Stakeholders include anyone with an interest in the project. They can include the customer or end user, members of the project team, other people in the organization the project will affect and outside organizations or individuals with an interest.
2.  **Define roles.** Each stakeholder's role should be clearly defined. Some people will fill multiple roles, however.
3.  **Introduce stakeholders.** Hold a meeting to bring stakeholders together and unify the vision behind the project. The topics covered should include scope, goals, budget, schedule and roles.
4.  **Set goals.** Take what is gleaned from the meeting and refine it into a project plan. It should include goals and deliverables that define what the product or service will result in.
5.  **Prioritize tasks.** List tasks necessary to meet goals and prioritize them based on importance and interdependencies. A Gantt chart can be helpful for mapping project dependencies.
6.  **Create a schedule.** Establish a timeline that considers the resources needed for all the tasks.
7.  **Assess risks.** Identify project risks and develop strategies for mitigating them.
8.  **Communicate.** Share the plan with all stakeholders and provide communications updates in the format and frequency stakeholders expect.
9.  **Reassess.** As milestones are met, revisit the project plan and revise any areas that are not meeting expectations.
10.  **Final evaluation.** Once the project is completed, performance should be evaluated to learn from the experience and identify areas to improve.
11.  Budget


1.  Define project goals and objectives: Determine the project's overall goals and objectives, and identify the key stakeholders and their requirements.
    
2.  Develop a project plan: Create a detailed project plan that includes a timeline, budget, and resource allocation.
    
3.  Create a project team: Assemble a project team that includes developers, designers, project managers, and other key stakeholders.
    
4.  Establish project milestones: Break the project down into smaller, more manageable milestones that can be tracked and measured.
    
5.  Determine project scope: Define the project's scope and deliverables, and identify any potential risks or challenges.
    
6.  Develop a project schedule: Create a detailed project schedule that outlines all of the tasks and milestones, along with deadlines and dependencies.
    
7.  Assign responsibilities: Assign specific tasks and responsibilities to team members, and establish clear lines of communication and accountability.
    
8.  Monitor progress: Track progress against the project plan, and make adjustments as necessary to ensure that the project stays on track and within budget.
    
9.  Review and refine: Regularly review the project plan and adjust it as necessary to reflect changes in scope, requirements, or other factors.


## Project Planning Tools

Project planning tools help everyone concerned keep track of project requirements and deadlines. Some of the most popular project planning tools include the following:

### Gantt Chart

-   [Gantt charts](https://www.projectmanager.com/gantt-chart "Gantt charts") are an industry standard that helps in tracking both time and interdependencies between tasks
-   Gantt charts are an essential tool to show different phases, jobs, and resources involved in project management

### Critical Path Method (CPM)

-   [Critical Path Method](https://hbr.org/1963/09/the-abcs-of-the-critical-path-method "Critical Path Method") (CPM) is a crucial tool for determining the progress of the project to ensure that the project is on schedule
-   CPM helps in determining the essential or critical path by finding out the longest stretch of dependent tasks

### PERT Chart

-   [The Program Evaluation and Review Technique](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pert-chart.asp "The Program Evaluation and Review Technique") (PERT) helps in analyzing the tasks to complete the project and the time required to complete those tasks
-   PERT simplifies the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

-   [Work Breakdown Structure](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/applying-work-breakdown-structure-project-lifecycle-6979 "Work Breakdown Structure") (WBS) is a process of organizing the team's work into manageable sections
-   WBS is a hierarchical structure of the deliverables needed to complete the project

### Project Documentation

-   [Project documentation](https://www.simplilearn.com/project-documentation-article "Project documentation") is created during the project lifecycle, which involves project scope, its schedule, and the risk analysis
-   Project documents help in better understanding and risk analysis of the project
