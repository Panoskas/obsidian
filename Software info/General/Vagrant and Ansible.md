In a nutshell, Vagrant is a tool (modular framework) for working with virtual environments, and in most circumstances, this means working with **virtual machines**  
Vagrant provides a simple and easy to use **command-line** client for managing these environments, and an interpreter for the text-based definitions of what each environment looks like, called Vagrantfiles

-   **Definitions**
    -   **Box**: A box is a packaged Vagrant environment, typically a virtual machine.
    -   **Provider**: A provider is the location in which the virtual environment runs. It can be local (the default is to use VirtualBox), remote, or even a special case like a [Docker](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker) container.
    -   **Provisioner**: A provisioner is a tool to set up the virtual environment, and can be as simple as a shell script, but alternatively a more advanced tool like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible can be used.


Vagrant and Ansible work together to automate the setup and provisioning of virtual environments. Vagrant is a tool that allows developers to create and manage virtual machines, while Ansible is a configuration management and automation tool.

By using Vagrant to create and manage virtual machines, and Ansible to configure and provision those machines, developers can easily spin up and configure entire development environments with just a few commands. Vagrant can be configured to use Ansible as the provisioner, which means that when Vagrant creates a new virtual machine, it will automatically run Ansible playbooks to configure and provision the machine according to the developer's specifications.

This allows developers to easily create and manage virtual environments that are consistent across different machines and development stages, which can improve collaboration and reduce errors.

### Example
First, you'll need to have Vagrant and Ansible installed on your machine.

Next, you'll create a new directory for your project and initialize it with Vagrant by running the command vagrant init. This will create a default Vagrantfile in your project directory.

In the Vagrantfile, you'll specify the settings for your virtual machine, such as the operating system to use, the amount of memory and CPU to allocate, and the network settings.

Next, you'll configure Vagrant to use Ansible as the provisioner. You can do this by adding the following line to the Vagrantfile: config.vm.provision "ansible"

In the same directory, you'll create an Ansible playbook, which is a set of instructions that tells Ansible how to configure and provision the virtual machine. For example, the playbook might specify which packages to install, what users to create, and what services to start.

Finally, you can use the command vagrant up to create and provision the virtual machine according to the settings specified in the Vagrantfile and the Ansible playbook.

And that's it! With these steps, Vagrant will use your Ansible playbooks to configure and provision your virtual machine. You can then use Vagrant commands to start, stop, or destroy the machine as needed.
