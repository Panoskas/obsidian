## Intro
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Here's an overview of Kubernetes and its key components:

1. Cluster: The foundation of Kubernetes, consisting of a set of machines (nodes) that run containerized applications.

2. Control Plane:
   - API Server: The front-end for the Kubernetes control plane, handling internal and external requests.
   - etcd: A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data.
   - Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and constraints.
   - Controller Manager: Runs controller processes to regulate the state of the cluster.

3. Nodes:
   - Kubelet: An agent that runs on each node, ensuring containers are running in a pod.
   - Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).
   - Kube-proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes, enabling communication between pods.

4. Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.

5. Services: An abstraction layer that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them.

6. Volumes: A directory containing data, accessible to containers in a pod.

7. Namespaces: Virtual clusters that provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or projects.

8. ConfigMaps and Secrets: Used to store configuration data and sensitive information, respectively.

9. Deployments: Describe the desired state for pods and ReplicaSets, enabling declarative updates.

10. StatefulSets: Manage stateful applications, providing unique network identities and persistent storage.

11. DaemonSets: Ensure that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a specific pod.

12. Ingress: Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

These components work together to provide a robust platform for container orchestration, enabling efficient management of containerized applications at scale.
