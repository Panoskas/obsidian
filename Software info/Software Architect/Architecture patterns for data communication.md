### 1. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Pattern

The Peer-to-Peer pattern fosters direct communication between two or more components without the need for a central coordinator.

In this decentralized model, each node in the network can act as both a client and a server, enabling efficient resource sharing and collaboration.

P2P architectures are commonly used in file sharing systems, decentralized applications (DApps), and blockchain networks, where resilience and scalability are paramount.

### 2. API Gateway Pattern

An [API Gateway](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2023/04/what-is-api-gateway-design-pattern-in.html) serves as a unified entry point for client requests to access backend services within an application.

By consolidating multiple APIs into a single interface, it simplifies client-server interactions and enforces security, authentication, and rate limiting policies.

API Gateways are essential components in [microservices architectures](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/09/microservices-design-patterns-principles.html), [enabling service discovery,](https://medium.com/javarevisited/service-discovery-in-java-microservices-using-spring-cloud-eureka-1ca3183844ba) load balancing, and protocol translation while abstracting the complexities of backend systems.

### 3. Pub-Sub (Publish-Subscribe)

The Pub-Sub pattern **decouples** message producers (publishers) from consumers (subscribers) through a message broker or event bus like [Kafka](https://medium.com/javarevisited/apache-kafka-why-is-kafka-so-fast-how-does-it-work-7e0fd1a560ae), Solace, [RabbitMQ](https://medium.com/javarevisited/difference-between-rabbitmq-apache-kafka-and-activemq-65e26b923114), or ActiveMQ.

Publishers broadcast messages to predefined topics or channels, while subscribers express interest in specific topics and receive relevant messages asynchronously.

Pub-Sub architectures facilitate loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance, making them ideal for real-time messaging systems, [event-driven microservices](https://medium.com/javarevisited/what-is-event-sourcing-design-pattern-in-microservices-architecture-how-does-it-work-b38c996d445a), and IoT platforms.

### 4. Request-Response Pattern

The Request-Response pattern represents the fundamental interaction model in distributed systems, where a client sends a request to a server and awaits a corresponding response.

This [synchronous communication paradigm](https://medium.com/p/31ca01027c53) is prevalent in web applications, RESTful APIs, and RPC (Remote Procedure Call) frameworks.

Request-Response interactions ensure predictable behavior and enable error handling, making them suitable for transactional workflows and user-facing interfaces.

### 5. Event Sourcing Pattern

Event Sourcing is a distributed system pattern for persisting the state of an application as a sequence of immutable events.

Instead of storing current state directly, events representing state transitions are stored and replayed to reconstruct the application state when needed.

**Event Sourcing** enables auditability, temporal querying, and replayability, making it well-suited for financial systems, collaborative editing tools, and domain-driven designs where historical data is crucial.

Here is **how a Event Sourcing pattern** looks like:


### 6. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pattern

ETL is a data integration pattern used to extract data from multiple sources, transform it into a standardized format, and load it into a destination database or data warehouse.

This pattern is essential for data migration, synchronization, and consolidation tasks in business intelligence, [data analytics](https://medium.com/javarevisited/review-is-google-advanced-data-analytics-certificate-on-coursera-worth-it-2a45a3a195e2), and data warehousing projects.

ETL pipelines automate data workflows, handle data quality issues, and support batch processing of large datasets.

### 7. Batching Pattern

Batching involves accumulating data over a period or until a certain threshold is reached before processing it as a single unit.

By aggregating multiple operations into larger batches, it reduces overhead and improves efficiency in data processing pipelines.

Batching is commonly employed in data ingestion, ETL processes, and distributed computing frameworks to optimize resource utilization and minimize latency.

### 9. Streaming Processing Pattern

_Streaming Processing_ enables the continuous ingestion, processing, and analysis of data streams in real-time. Unlike batch processing, which operates on static datasets, streaming systems handle infinite data streams with low latency and high throughput.

Streaming architectures support event-driven processing, complex event processing (CEP), and real-time analytics applications in domains such as finance, [IoT](https://medium.com/javarevisited/is-introduction-to-programming-the-internet-of-things-iot-specialization-on-coursera-worth-it-55085dd5ccc9), and [cybersecurity](https://medium.com/javarevisited/top-8-cybersecurity-certification-and-courses-on-coursera-for-2024-9d1c5bf241d7).

### 10. Orchestration Pattern

**Orchestration** involves a central coordinator (an orchestrator) managing the interactions between distributed components or services to execute a workflow or business process.

By coordinating task execution, handling exceptions, and enforcing dependencies, orchestration ensures the orderly execution of complex workflows spanning multiple systems.

Orchestration engines are used in workflow automation, business process management (BPM), and microservices orchestration to streamline operations and improve agility.
